# AI USE 

We used AI to help us with different parts of our coding assignment. AI assisted us in adding threading and locks to our hash table functions, starting from basic code we had already written. It helped us understand how to make our code thread-safe.

AI also helped with debugging. We asked it to look over our code to ensure we were freeing all allocated memory properly. Additionally, we used AI to help fix issues with our CMake file and to understand how to set it up correctly for our project.
