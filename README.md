# AI USE 

We essentially split the tasks of working on the different functions amongst the five of us: Luke was in charge of the file handling and memory allocation, Jesuel was in charge of the insert(), Ellie on delete(), Matt on search(), and Julian on print(). We took it upon ourselves to come up with traditional hash table functions before getting AI involved.

Once we had basic hashtable functions, we utilized AI to help us with different parts of our coding assignment, mainly the threading and locking functionalities. For example, the AI assisted us in adding threading and locks to our hash table functions, showing us how to include them at the start and end of each function. It took the basic functions we had written and enhanced them with threading and locking functionality. Morever, it helped us understand how to make our code thread-safe with its explanations.

AI also helped us with debugging. We asked it to look over our code to ensure we were freeing all allocated memory properly, and that we were reading in the commands properly. Additionally, we used AI to help us come up with our Makefile, and help us understand how it worked as it was the first time we had made one. It went into detailed explanations and ultimately allowed us to correcly implement it in our project.
